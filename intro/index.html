	<!--
		We always put our JS files at the bottom of our HTML for 2 reasons:
		1. PERFORMANCE: JS is a blocking resource, which means it forces the
			browser to wait for it to finish downloading before the browser
			can continue rendering.
			Our users perceive that the website loads faster if it gets
			rendered before the JS starts downloading
		2. HTML MANIPULATION: We want to manipulate HTML with our JS, but the
			HTML must be rendered to the screen before JS can do anything

		// Write JS directly between the two tags
		// Only use this if you want your JS code to work only on this HTML page
